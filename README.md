# Statistical Machine Learning

## Introduction 
We were asked to pick and a do a small project in a given list. We choosed to do the following:

### Task
 Auto-encoders are neural networks that provide non-linear generalization of principal component analysis
 (PCA). The general principle is to build a compressed version of the data that would allow to reconstruct
 them as well as possible. The compressed version is obtained on the central hidden layer and the input and
 output are the data that needs to be “encoded”. The model is thus trained to reconstruct the input data for
 example for the square loss. The goal of the project is to understand the similarities and difference between
 PCA and auto-encoders, to train an auto-encoder on real data, and possibly to compare the performance of
 the auto-encoder and of PCA on a denoising task.

### Github organization
Since we were not using Github for the project I have been unable to retrieve the code, which is why there is only the [Report](Report.pdf) and the [Presentation](Presentation.pdf).
